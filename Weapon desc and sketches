Weapon stats: First 3 are kinda self explanatory imo. I would rate them on a scale of 1-5, meaning 1 is horrible, 5 is the best. 
Weapon Size: Small: Takes up one arm slot /Large: takes up two arm slots.
(F)ire Rate 
(D)amage
(A)ccuracy
(C)orruption: 
-	In the case of normal weapons, there wouldn`t be. Unless we want to have massive randomizations, which could be included in later stages of game development.
-	Unique weapons, either junk or overpowered ones would have some debuffs aka a downside. The aim of this mechanic is to allow the player if they want to get the weapon, knowing what they`d have to put up with as a side effect.
-	Side effects could include:
o	Movement speed debuff
o	Long recharge/reload time
o	Take more damage from enemies
o	Takes up an extra slot
o	Rotate/turn slower
o	Reduce a stat of the other weapon
o	Super fast fire rate, but low damage/poor accuracy
o	More enemies spawn
o	Can only be replaced by another corrupted weapon.
-	I can only guess how much of a pain most of this could be to code, these are just first thoughts, I will look into more roguelikes as time allows and adjust/update these ideas.
 

Base weapons: Type-01 Series

Type-01 Pistol “Peashooter”
-	Small Weapon
-	Easy to get, simple to use, and is considered non lethal…unless you shoot someone in the head a dozen times, then it could work. It`s all I could afford, and it`s all I have to work with, for now.
o	(F)ire Rate ++
o	(D)amage +
o	(A)ccuracy +++
o	(C)orruption: „As if this thing could be any more worthless.”


Type-01 SMG “Rain of Peas”
-	Small Weapon
-	A faster version of the other gun…if you could call it a real gun.
o	(F)ire Rate ++++
o	(D)amage +
o	(A)ccuracy ++
o	(C)orruption: „It`s already bad with its inability to fire straightforward.”

Type-01 Shotgun "Pack of Peas"
-	Small weapon
-	Shoots lotsa tiny bullets. Packs a little punch if fired point blank. Take a step back however and not many are gonna hit.
o	(F)ire Rate +
o	(D)amage ++
o	(A)ccuracy ++
o	(C)orruption: „Horrible short range, but it is a shotgun after all”

“Discontinued” weapons, aka corrupted weapons:

Tri-beam laser gun

o	(A)ccuracy ++++
o	(C)orruption: „Greatly reduced movement speed while firing to compensate for battery usage.”

Spray and Pray(for yourself):
-	Small weapon
-	It shoots non-stop, seriously. Meant to be used for crowd control, ended up blowing the user`s arm off.
o	(F)ire Rate +++++
o	(D)amage ++
o	(A)ccuracy +
o	(C)orruption: „Firing for too long can harm user.”
